# AHB2APB Bridge Formal Verification

## Introduction
This repository contains all the materials related to the formal verification of an AHB2APB bridge, a critical component in SoC design facilitating communication between AHB and APB protocols. This project includes SystemVerilog assertions (SVA), Register Transfer Level (RTL) design files, a verification plan, and comprehensive documentation outlining the verification process and results.

## Contents Overview
- `RTL/`: Contains the RTL design files of the AHB2APB bridge.
- `sva/`: SystemVerilog assertions used for formal verification.
- `specs_sheets/`: Specifications and datasheets relevant to the AHB2APB bridge.
- `Verification_Plan/`: Documents outlining the planned verification strategies and methodologies.
- `run/`: Scripts and configurations used for running verification tests (Note: content may be ignored in Git tracking for privacy or size considerations).

## Getting Started
Explore the `RTL/` and `sva/` directories to examine the design and verification elements directly.

## Contribution Guidelines
Contributions to enhance the verification process or improve the design are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit pull requests with your proposed changes. For major changes, kindly open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
