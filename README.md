# 🚀 AHB2APB Bridge Formal Verification

## 📚 Introduction
Welcome to the repository dedicated to the **formal verification** of the AHB2APB bridge, a pivotal component in System-on-Chip (SoC) design that ensures seamless communication between the AHB and APB protocols. This project is packed with:
- 🛠️ **SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA)**
- 📐 **Register Transfer Level (RTL) design files**
- 📝 **A detailed verification plan**
- 📊 **Comprehensive documentation** outlining the verification process and results

## 🌉 AHB to APB Bridge Overview
The AHB to APB Bridge is a crucial component in SoC architectures, acting as a conduit between the high-performance AHB (Advanced High-performance Bus) and the lower-power APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus). This bridge facilitates efficient data transfer and control signal communication, optimizing the performance and power consumption of integrated circuits.

### 🏢 Industry Relevance
In the current tech landscape, companies like Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA leverage such bridge designs to enhance the efficiency and performance of their SoCs. These bridges are integral in managing the communication between high-speed processing units and peripheral devices, ensuring that their products meet the demands of modern computing tasks, from data centers to consumer electronics.
